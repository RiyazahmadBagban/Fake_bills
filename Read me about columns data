In this notebook we are going to predict if a bank note is true or false based on different measurements. There are five measurements:

length, the length of the banknote in mm
height left, the height of the left side of the banknote in mm
height right, the height of the right side of the bank note in mm
diagonal, the diagonal of the bank note in mm
margin low, lower side margin in mm
margin up, upper side margin in mm
